WAX Resource planner

Originally created by EOS Newyork, https://github.com/eosnewyork/erp many thanks for their open source contribution.

For those looking for the specific commits that were done on the original code ,
it was first submitted here https://github.com/telosrp/telosrp.github.io as we worked on the telos resource planner, and then adapted it for WAX.

I would like to also acknowledge the help of:
   * bguezzie who re-worked the jquery logic.

Drop me a message or open a github issue if you have any suggestions.
